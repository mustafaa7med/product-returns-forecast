# Project: Product Returns Analysis and ML Time-Series Forecasting
## Objective:
A company seeks to analyze product returns for three products after experiencing a high volume of returns. They aim to determine whether this trend is driven by customer behavior or potential issues with the products. 
Therefore, this project focuses on analyzing product returns and implementing ML-based forecasting to:

- Identify Potential Product Defects.
- Predict Product Return Rates through Machine Learning.
- Reduce Return Rate.
- Improve Supply Chain Efficiency.
- Enhance Customer Satisfaction.
- Cost Reduction.
